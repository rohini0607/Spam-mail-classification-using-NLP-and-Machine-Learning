# Spam-mail-classification-using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning

This project is a machine learning application that classifies emails as spam or ham using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the Multinomial Naïve Bayes algorithm. A Streamlit-based web interface is provided for real-time email classification.

## Features
- Preprocesses email text (cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization).
- Classifies emails using a trained Naïve Bayes model.
- User-friendly web application deployed via Streamlit.

## Installation
- Clone the repository:
-     https://github.com/rohini-hash/Spam-mail-classification-using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning.git
- Navigate to the project directory:
-     cd spam-classification
- Install the required dependencies:
-     pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the application:
-     streamlit run app.py
